# 🎲 Random Quiz Feature - Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Quizzes now show **10 random questions** each time, providing variety and preventing students from memorizing question order!

---

## ✨ What Changed

### **Before** ❌
- Showed ALL questions in database
- Same order every time
- Students could memorize answers
- Long quizzes (20+ questions)

### **After** ✅
- Shows maximum **10 questions**
- **Random selection** each time
- **Shuffled order**
- Fresh experience every attempt
- Can repeat questions (good for practice!)

---

## 🎲 How It Works

### **Random Selection Process**

```
1. Student selects difficulty (e.g., "Medium")
2. System fetches all Medium questions from database
3. Questions are shuffled randomly
4. First 10 questions are selected
5. Quiz starts with these 10 questions
```

### **Example**

**Database has 25 Medium questions:**
```
Questions: Q1, Q2, Q3, ... Q25
```

**First Attempt:**
```
Shuffled: Q15, Q3, Q22, Q8, Q11, Q19, Q2, Q25, Q7, Q14
Shows: First 10 → Q15, Q3, Q22, Q8, Q11, Q19, Q2, Q25, Q7, Q14
```

**Second Attempt (Different!):**
```
Shuffled: Q9, Q18, Q4, Q21, Q1, Q13, Q24, Q6, Q17, Q10
Shows: First 10 → Q9, Q18, Q4, Q21, Q1, Q13, Q24, Q6, Q17, Q10
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: Large Question Pool**

**Setup:**
```
Topic: "Introduction to Integers"
Total Questions: 30 (10 easy, 15 medium, 5 hard)
```

**Student Experience:**
```
Attempt 1: Gets 10 random medium questions
Attempt 2: Gets different 10 medium questions
Attempt 3: May see some repeats, but in different order
```

### **Scenario 2: Small Question Pool**

**Setup:**
```
Topic: "Advanced Calculus"
Total Questions: 8 medium questions
```

**Student Experience:**
```
Quiz shows all 8 questions (less than 10)
Still shuffled randomly each time
```

### **Scenario 3: Mixed Difficulty**

**Setup:**
```
Student selects: "All Difficulties"
Total Questions: 50 (all difficulties)
```

**Student Experience:**
```
Gets 10 random questions from all 50
Mix of easy, medium, hard
Different mix each time
```

---

## 🔢 Question Limits

### **Maximum 10 Questions**

```
If database has:
- 5 questions → Shows 5
- 10 questions → Shows 10
- 15 questions → Shows 10 (random)
- 50 questions → Shows 10 (random)
- 100 questions → Shows 10 (random)
```

### **Minimum Questions**

```
If database has:
- 0 questions → Shows "No questions available"
- 1 question → Shows 1 question
- 2-9 questions → Shows all available
```

## 🎲 Randomization Algorithm

### **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**

```typescript
const shuffleArray = <T,>(array: T[]): T[] => {
  const shuffled = [...array];
  for (let i = shuffled.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [shuffled[i], shuffled[j]] = [shuffled[j], shuffled[i]];
  }
  return shuffled;
};
```

**Properties:**
- ✅ Truly random
- ✅ Unbiased
- ✅ Efficient
- ✅ Every question has equal chance

## 📈 Impact on Progress Tracking

### **Still Tracks Everything**

Even with random questions, progress tracking works:

```
Attempt 1: 10 random questions, score 70%
Attempt 2: 10 different questions, score 80%
Attempt 3: 10 questions (some repeats), score 90%

System tracks:
- All 3 attempts
- Average score: 80%
- Improvement: +20%
- Weak areas identified
```

### **Better Assessment**

Random questions provide:
- ✅ More accurate skill assessment
- ✅ Can't memorize specific answers
- ✅ Tests actual understanding
- ✅ Multiple attempts encouraged

## 💡 Best Practices

### **For Teachers**

**1. Build Large Question Pools**
```
Recommended: 20-30 questions per difficulty
Minimum: 10 questions per difficulty
Benefit: More variety for students
```

**2. Use AI Generation**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Implementation**

```typescript
// 1. Filter by difficulty
const questions = selectedDifficulty === 'all' 
  ? topicData.questions 
  : topicData.questions.filter(q => q.difficulty === selectedDifficulty);

// 2. Shuffle randomly
const shuffled = shuffleArray(questions);

// 3. Take first 10
const limitedQuestions = shuffled.slice(0, Math.min(10, shuffled.length));

// 4. Use in quiz
setFilteredQuestions(limitedQuestions);
```

### **Triggers New Shuffle**

Random selection happens when:
- ✅ Student starts new quiz
