# 🎯 Quiz Enhancements - Complete Guide

## 🎉 Overview

Your Ontario Math Academy now has **two major quiz enhancements**:

1. **AI Question Deduplication** - Prevents duplicate questions
2. **Student Progress Tracking** - Tracks performance and provides personalized recommendations

---

## ✨ Feature 1: AI Question Deduplication

### **What It Does**

When generating AI questions, the system now:
- ✅ Checks existing questions in the database
- ✅ Filters out duplicates automatically
- ✅ Only saves unique questions
- ✅ Reports how many duplicates were filtered

### **How It Works**

**Before Generating:**
```
Database has: "What is 2 + 2?"
AI generates: "What is 2 + 2?" ← Duplicate!
              "What is 3 + 3?" ← Unique
```

**After Filtering:**
```
Saved: "What is 3 + 3?" only
Filtered: 1 duplicate
Console: "✅ Saved 1 unique question (1 duplicate filtered)"
```

### **Similarity Detection**

The system uses smart similarity checking:
- Normalizes text (removes punctuation, lowercase)
- Compares first 20 characters
- Detects similar questions even with slight variations

**Examples:**
```
Existing: "What is the value of x in 2x + 3 = 7?"
Similar:  "What is x in 2x + 3 = 7?" ← Filtered
Different: "What is the value of y in 2y + 5 = 11?" ← Saved
```

### **Variation Strategy**

AI can generate variations by changing:
- ✅ Numbers: `2x + 3` → `3x + 5`
- ✅ Variables: `x` → `y` or `a`
- ✅ Context: Temperature → Elevation
- ✅ Wording: "Calculate" → "Find" → "Determine"

## ✨ Feature 2: Student Progress Tracking

### **What It Tracks**

For each quiz attempt:
- ✅ Student ID
- ✅ Topic
- ✅ Difficulty level
- ✅ Score (percentage)
- ✅ Time spent
- ✅ Individual question responses
- ✅ Timestamp

### **Progress Metrics**

**Overall Progress:**
- Total attempts
- Average score across all quizzes
- Best scores per topic
- Improvement over time

**Topic-Specific:**
- Attempts per topic
- Average score per topic
- Best score achieved
- Improvement trend

**Recommendations:**
- Weak topics (< 70%)
- Strong topics (≥ 80%)
- Topics needing review

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking Features

### **1. Automatic Tracking**

Every quiz attempt is automatically saved:
```typescript
{
  studentId: "student123",
  topicId: 5,
  difficulty: "medium",
  totalQuestions: 10,
  correctAnswers: 7,
  scorePercentage: 70,
  timeSpent: 180, // seconds
  completed_at: "2025-09-30 12:00:00"
}
```

### **2. Performance Analysis**

**Weak Topics Detection:**
- Topics with average score < 70%
- Sorted by lowest score first
- Up to 5 recommendations

**Strong Topics Recognition:**
- Topics with average score ≥ 80%
- Sorted by highest score

### **3. Personalized Recommendations**

**After Failing (< 60%):**
```
❌ Score: 55%
📚 Recommendation: "Review the lesson content to improve your understanding."
🔗 Link: Direct link to topic content page
```

**After Passing (≥ 60%):**
